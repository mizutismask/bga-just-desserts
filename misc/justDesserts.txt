logging is not visible if written from the constructor or gameSetup,	

The rules say there is only one winner and others are loosers. Itâ€™s impossible to tell someone did better than others because of the different objectives. So only the winner gets points. 100 points because he won. And some points to reflect how many guests he has satisfied.

Sorry if it's not clear, indeed don't hesitate to update the wiki page if needed to clarify.
_() should never be used in php code for games as it will match the mainsite translation and not the game translations
_() should be used in javascript code for strings to translate client side (and there are no other strings in javascript so it should be the only case theree)
self::_() in php code marks the game strings to be translated on the server side (and applies the translation at runtime as mentioned by Tisaac), so strings marked only with self::_() will be only included in the server localization files (gettext .po/.mo files) to translate server side
clienttranslate() in php code marks the strings to be translated on the client side, so strings marked only with clienttranslate will be only included in the client localization files (js) to translate client side

Coming back to the issue of double translation, can you make a test also without the i18n? This would help narrow down where to look for this issue.

//todo
@keyframes flip {
  0%   { transform: scale(1); }
  10%  { transform: scale(1.2); }
  90%  { transform: rotateY(180deg) scale(1.2); }
  100% { transform: rotateY(180deg) scale(1); }
}

(don't forget the 'animation-fill-mode: forwards;' on your class)
